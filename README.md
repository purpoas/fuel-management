This report provides an in-depth analysis of fuel inventory management across various gas station locations in Canada. By examining fuel consumption patterns, purchasing behaviors, and inventory levels, we aim to identify opportunities for cost savings and efficiency improvements. Our analysis focuses on evaluating the potential benefits of optimizing purchasing strategies, considering inflation, and assessing the need for increasing tank capacities, along with other potential strategies. Based on our findings, we propose recommendations which enhance inventory management practices and achieve cost-effective operations.
